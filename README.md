### An application that can be used to convert hand movements into speech with an android phone.

More than seven and a half million people in the US have a speech disability or impediment that requires them to employ the help of a speaking aid to communicate. The most common aid is sign language, but sign language cannot be used universally as both parties must have a functional understanding of the language. Other aids, such as sign language to speech gloves or picture boards, also have similar problems. 

In this project, an application was designed to create a hassle-free system of communication between those who cannot speak orally and those who can. This solution used combinations of different angles and touchscreen sections on a phone screen to make words, and eventually speech, and was coded for an Android phone using Android Studio with Java.
